                <h3>Navigational Steps to Backup Google Data to StorX</h3>

                <p>
                    In today’s digital workplace, Google Workspace serves as the backbone of productivity—powering
                    emails,
                    documents, storage, and collaboration for millions of businesses worldwide. However, with increasing
                    cyber threats and rising incidents of account breaches, organizations face a critical question:
                    What happens to all that vital data if your Workspace gets hacked?
                </p>

                <p>
                    To address this challenge, StorX Network has introduced seamless integration with Google Workspace,
                    offering decentralized, end-to-end encrypted storage and backup. This integration ensures that even
                    if
                    your Workspace account is compromised, your data remains secure, recoverable, and protected from any
                    single point of failure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    5.As shown in the above UI, there are two sections available for backing up Google data to StorX:

                    <br> II. Auto-Mail Sync
                </p>

                <h3>Manual Backup</h3>

                <p>
                    Let’s walk through the process of manually backing up your Google data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Google Photos
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>To manually back up your Google Photos, select Google Photos from the Backup Tool page. You'll
                        be prompted to grant access to your Google account—once authorized, you'll be redirected to the
                        Google Photos Album Listing page, as shown below.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="img-wrapper">
                    <img src="/static/static/images/documentation/googlebackup/image12.png" alt="">

                <ul>
                    <li>Now, select an album to see a list of the photos it contains. The images from your Google Photos
                        account will be displayed as shown below.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="img-wrapper">

                    <img src="/static/static/images/documentation/googlebackup/image4.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Finally, navigate to the Vault listing page, locate the “google-photos” vault, and preview its
                        contents to verify that your photos have been successfully uploaded. The vault content will
                        appear as shown below.

                        based on scheduled Date.

                    <li>Finally, navigate to the Vault Listing page, locate the vault named “gmail”, preview the folder
                        corresponding to the mail set for auto-sync, and confirm that the data has been successfully
                        synced and uploaded to StorX, as shown below.
                    </li>

                    restore all data or selected items based on available restore points.
                </p>

                <ul>

                        select the vault named “gmail” and select the mail you want to restore as shown below.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    As cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on centralized protection is no
                    longer enough. The StorX–Google Workspace integration provides businesses with a vital layer of
                    resilience: decentralized backups that safeguard emails, documents, and files against breaches,
                    ransomware, and accidental loss. More than just secure storage, StorX guarantees data sovereignty,
                    privacy, and reliable recoverability—empowering organizations to focus on growth without fear of
                    disruption. In today’s digital landscape, where trust drives competitiveness, this integration is
                    not just a safeguard—it’s a strategic advantage.
