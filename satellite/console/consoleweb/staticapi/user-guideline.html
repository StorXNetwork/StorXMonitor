                    <p>
                        StorX is a Decentralize Cloud Storage Network designed for secure and reliable file storage, featuring inherent economic incentives and cryptographic mechanisms to ensure highest privacy and security of stored data over time. In StorX Network, users make payments to store their files with Independent Storage Node Operators, which are responsible for securely storing and validating the correctness of stored files over time. Anyone interested in either storing their own files or earning compensation for storing others' files can participate in the StorX Network Ecosystem. Using an already available Storage Capacity helps StorX to keep the cost for Storage Low compared to other centralized players in market.

                    <p>
                        StorX supports various use cases, ranging from Backups / Web2 /Web3 assets to incentivized permanent storage and cost-effective archiving of Web2 datasets as an alternative to traditional cloud storage. StorX accommodates a diverse array of data formats, including audio and video files.

                    <h3 class="medium small">How Storage Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        In StorX Ecosystem, users can rent out their storage capacity to the network in exchange for StorX Tokens (SRX), the platform's native cryptocurrency. These tokens are also used within the StorX Network for retrieval services and payment for storage.

                    <p>
                        A key technical innovation is the implementation of Erasure coding (EC) , This technique ensures encrypted files are broken down into smaller pieces and distributes them across multiple nodes in the network, ensuring data durability and high availability through redundancy.

                    <h3 class="medium small">Creating a Vault</h3>

                    <p>
                        StorX deploys vault methodology to systematically store file to StorX. All files must be stored on vault, There is no limit to number of Vaults that can be created by users. Users can also create new folders and store individual files under Vault. Each vault will have its unique passphrase, This means the users can have multiple Vaults and multiple password for each Vaults. Vault names needs to be created in Alpha Numeric and should be in lower characters only. If the users wants to Upload, Download or Share a File, He would have to first click in respective Vault, fetch the details after putting in passphrase.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="medium small">Creating an encryption Passphrase</h3>

                    <p>
                        In order to enhance privacy and security of data stored on StorX, Users must encrypt each Vault with its unique Passphrase, Passphrase is like unique encryption key combination for each Vault. Passphrase is unique for each Vault and this information resides strictly on user PC/Laptop. User Passphrase is never share with StorX or its Storage Node Operators. This information is unique and the primary enabler for enhanced security on StorX ecosystem. Passphrase can never be retrieved or reset by the users. If the users loses passphrase, he would loose the access to the data.
                    </p>
