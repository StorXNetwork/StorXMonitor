                <h3>WHAT IS STORX?</h3>

                <p>
                    StorX is a Decentralized Cloud Storage Network designed for secure and reliable file storage,
                    featuring inherent economic incentives and cryptographic mechanisms to ensure highest privacy and
                    security of stored data over time. In StorX Network, users make payments to store their files with
                    Independent Storage Node Operators, which are responsible for securely storing and validating the
                    correctness of stored files over time. Anyone interested in either storing their own files or
                    earning compensation for storing others' files can participate in the StorX Network Ecosystem. Using
                    an already available Storage Capacity helps StorX to keep the cost for Storage Low compared to other
                    centralized players in the market.
                </p>

                <p>
                    StorX supports various use cases, ranging from Backups / Web2 / Web3 assets to incentivize permanent
                    storage and cost-effective archiving of Web2 datasets as an alternative to traditional cloud
                    storage. StorX accommodates a diverse array of data formats, including audio and video files.
                </p>

                <h3>How Storage Works</h3>

                <p>
                    In StorX Ecosystem, users can rent out their storage capacity to the network in exchange for StorX
                    Tokens (SRX), the platform's native cryptocurrency. These tokens are also used within the StorX
                    Network for retrieval services and payment for storage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A key technical innovation is the implementation of Erasure coding (EC). This technique ensures
                    encrypted files are broken down into smaller pieces and distributes them across multiple nodes in
                    the network, ensuring data durability and high availability through redundancy.
                </p>

                <h3>Dashboard</h3>

                <p>
                    Upon successful login, you will be directed to the StorX dashboard. Here, you'll find an account
                    overview (including vault count, access grants, and billing type), a list of your vaults, and
                    detailed bandwidth/storage stats. You can also click any option in the sidebar to navigate to
                    specific sections for more details.

                <h3>Creating a Vault</h3>

                <p>
                    StorX employs a vault-based methodology for systematic file storage. All files must be stored within
                    a vault, and users can create an unlimited number of vaults as needed. Within each vault, you can
                    organize content by creating folders and storing individual files. Please note that vault names must
                    adhere to specific naming conventions: they should be alphanumeric (Enter lowercase alphanumeric
                    characters only no spaces allowed).
                </p>

                </div>

                <h3>Accessing Vault and more</h3>

                <p>
                    Once your vault is successfully created, you can select it to access its detail page. From here,
                    you'll be able to perform various operations, such as uploading individual files, uploading entire
                    folders, or creating new folders. To simplify the process, StorX also supports drag-and-drop
                    functionality for seamless file and folder uploads, making the experience both efficient and
                    user-friendly.
