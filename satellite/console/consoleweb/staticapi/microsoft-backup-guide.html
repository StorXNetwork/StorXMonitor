                <h3>Backing Up and Restoring Outlook Data in StorX</h3>

                <p>
                    The StorX Outlook Backup feature enables users to securely back up and restore their Microsoft
                    Outlook
                    data using StorX’s decentralized, end-to-end encrypted storage network. This feature helps ensure
                    business continuity by protecting emails, attachments, calendars,
                    contacts,
                    and other Outlook data from accidental deletion, corruption, ransomware, or account compromise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Users can choose between manual backups, automatic scheduled backups, and on-demand data
                    restoration,
                    giving full control over data protection and recovery.
                </p>

                <h3>Supported Backup Methods</h3>

                <p>StorX supports the following Outlook data backup options:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Manual Backup</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Allows users to initiate a backup of their Outlook data at any time. This option is ideal for
                    one-time
                    backups or before making major changes to the mailbox.
                </p>

                <p><strong>2. Automatic Backup</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Enables scheduled backups to run automatically at predefined intervals. This ensures continuous data
                    protection without manual intervention.
                </p>

                <p><strong>3. Data Restore</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Allows users to restore Outlook data from a previously created backup. Users can choose to restore
                    all
                    data or selected items based on available restore points.
                </p>

                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

                <p>Before backing up Outlook data, ensure the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An active StorX account</li>
                    <li>Access to a Microsoft Outlook account</li>
                    <li>Required permissions granted to StorX for accessing Outlook data</li>
                    <li>Stable internet connection</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Let’s see the steps in working.</h3>
