            <h3 class="medium small">WHAT IS STORX?</h3>
            <p>
                StorX is a Decentralized Cloud Storage Network designed for secure and reliable file storage, featuring inherent economic incentives and cryptographic mechanisms to ensure highest privacy and security of stored data over time. In StorX Network, users make payments to store their files with Independent Storage Node Operators, which are responsible for securely storing and validating the correctness of stored files over time. Anyone interested in either storing their own files or earning compensation for storing others' files can participate in the StorX Network Ecosystem. Using an already available Storage Capacity helps StorX to keep the cost for Storage Low compared to other centralized players in the market.
            </p>

            <p>
                StorX supports various use cases, ranging from Backups / Web2 /Web3 assets to incentivize permanent storage and cost-effective archiving of Web2 datasets as an alternative to traditional cloud storage. StorX accommodates a diverse array of data formats, including audio and video files.
            </p>

            <h3 class="medium small">How Storage Works</h3>
            <p>
                In StorX Ecosystem, users can rent out their storage capacity to the network in exchange for StorX Tokens (SRX), the platform's native cryptocurrency. These tokens are also used within the StorX Network for retrieval services and payment for storage.
            </p>

            <p>
                A key technical innovation is the implementation of Erasure coding (EC) , This technique ensures encrypted files are broken down into smaller pieces and distributes them across multiple nodes in the network, ensuring data durability and high availability through redundancy.

            <h3 class="medium small">Creating a Vault</h3>

            <p>
                StorX employs a vault-based methodology for systematic file storage. All files must be stored within a vault, and users can create an unlimited number of vaults as needed. Within each vault, you can organize content by creating folders and storing individual files. Please note that vault names must adhere to specific naming conventions: they should be alphanumeric (Enter lowercase alphanumeric characters only no spaces allowed).
            </p>

            <h3 class="medium small">Accessing Vault and more</h3>

            <p>
                Once your vault is successfully created, you can select it to access its detail page. From here, you'll be able to perform various operations, such as uploading individual files, uploading entire folders, or creating new folders. To simplify the process, StorX also supports drag-and-drop functionality for seamless file and folder uploads, making the experience both efficient and user-friendly.
